implemented a timer function, and setted up basic movement and such

01/11/23
used core_tool.tools into program, and added surfaces to train_image_loader.py

16/11/23
implementations:
- Tried to fix movement animation issue, weird but works better than usual
- added the background

issues:
- None 

Stage_3 im thinking needs re-imagining, maybe a bossfight type thing. would be so fun to make and document I think, since just like undertale, I can finally make something worth playing?

stage will go like:
- player walks and interacts with drunk person
- drunk person is annoyed and collides with player
- play cutscene with drunk person and player (a drunk person is approachin you)
- cut into a new combat mode, consisted of minigames that were used and a new one!
- new minigame is a platformer and stuff, avoid cracked glass bottles
- you have to endure this game for around 1 min
- the game will increasingly get faster and harder as you progress
- enemy continuosly mocks you with dialouge
- enemy gets tired and you manage to escape

tonight:
- design the sprites for the bossfight
- design the train details (sprites)
- try to get a moving background and stuff 
- blit all of these in the correct yeah 

main things need implementing:
- sprites
- enemy dialouge and cutscene things
- difficulty and stuff

Im sorRY I COULDNTINA HAHNUYTTHING!

19/11/23

- made the sprites for bossfight
- made some improvements on the map
- made new character sprite

22/12/23
implementations:
- deleted rectangle for speech, didn't feel good abt it
- made seperate font for the drunk to speak
- fixed index error when the player pressed space and it registered mult times

issues:
- collision between the player and the drunk is a bit janky but not too severe 

okay so im in filipines with a terrible mouse, so its gonna be hard to make good sprites so
i will be making temp sprites and focusing on the actual gameplay. 

NOW WHAT DO I HAVE PLANNED FOR THE GAMEPLAY?

there will be bottles raining down on the player and the box in undertale vibe thing, and the bottles will essentialy
explode and kill the player. This means that the player must avoid getting hit at all! To defeat the enemy, the player
has to survive for the time remaining. Has like 2 phases. The player needs to move left right up down amazing. So when
the enemy has been defeated, the player will go back to map 1, but the enemy will have left and got his buddies. Police
came into the train and saved the player and wohoo, game ends.

DETAILS:

Enemy attack lasts for 2 mins
1st phase (1st min): 
throwing bottles, 3 types of bottles, One has diff explosion radius than the other.

2nd phase (2nd min):
throwing bottles, faster.
