~ 20/10/23
implemented collision that is from stage_1 
designed background and sprites

~ 27/10/23
implemented the popup text with objects around the room

01/10/23
implemented core_tool functions

06/11/23
breakdown:
objects will have mingames assigned to them like last time
bins - place trash in wrong bin (mouse click and drag stuff)
toys - destroy toys (prob a spam)
alarm clock - keep ringing the alarm clock (bar)
fridge - eat (click all the food in time)

implemented a interactive object class 

looking for a productive day on wednesday! 😁😁

08/11/23
implementations:
- added "e to interact" text, and actual reaction when pressed e

10/11/23
implementations:
- None
issues:🌍 LOW BATTERY 

11/11/23
implementations:
- made new class for clickable object for click&drag minigame
- completely made click&drag minigame with no issues! (which is located in core_tools.minigames)
- added new disable attribute to interactive_object class (to prevent over blitting)

no mentionable issues other than animation too fast (like previously)

development for this stage has been very clean so far, OOP is proving its power and I'm liking it 
anyway im hoping to get this stage done by wed or tue next week.
final implementation will have to be done swiftly... (maybe ill just pray deadline increases)

50% complete so far, still need to add:
- enemies (brother,sister,dad,mom) 
- noise_meter (prob make it into core_tools.tools from stage_1.classroom_game)

to be fair, enemies can be the same as last stage, just different sprites...

anyway good night gaming

12/11/23
implementations:
- fully added click minigame
- prepared statement for enemy spawn

issues:
- fridge displaying when interact with fridge then trash...

fr 60% complete, same stuff needed from before

13/11/23
implementations:
- fixed issue from before (just need to make interaction tab false cuz kept running)
- added sprites for enemies
- added enemy class (not fully implemented)

issues:
- None

70% complete so far, just need to add:
- enemy movement & collision
- enemy difficulty & noise_meter
- enemy walk sprites 
- timer at beginning
- text for initiating dodge thingie

will work on timer and text tmrw or something, movement and stuff is the final stuff i'll do for this 
anyway, good run 👌

14/11/23
implementations:
- added sprite movement
- added enemy walk sprites 
- added enemy collision
- added restart screen

issues:
- None 

80% complete so far, just need to add:
- timer at beginning
- text for initiating dodge stage
- noise meter and difficulty stuffs

will work on these tmrw, try to finish this prototype and start working on train game. 
😴

15/11/23
implementations:
- added timer at beginning
- text for initiating dodge state

Issues:
- None 

90% complete just need to add noise meter

i need to migrate noise_meter into tools and the sprites for it cuz its a bit annoying to copy and paste the same code. probably will do tonight as this may require a lot of re-arragning and stuffs. pretty sure 'noise' doesn't have to be a global var.
see you tonight 🤤

15/11/23:
implementations:
- migrated noise_meter into tools and sprites! 
- done finish things

major issues:
- None 

minor issues:
- if player collides with two walls, the player can walk past one of them

Not really sure what to do with the last minor issue, but will probably come across the solution later on.
100% complete.
