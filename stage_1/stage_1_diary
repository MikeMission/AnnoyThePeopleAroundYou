Notes:

29/09/23
Partially implemented the bar minigame, thinking of implementing an instrument class
to use polymorphism for all the instruments to filter what ones need spam minigame and bar minigame
can also contain their sprites and other things... (although has to be inside asset_lib)

30/09/23
Fully implemented the bar minigame, trying to animate the player now, having weird problemsss
the idea from last time was pointless, and i need to fix animation the next time i come on.

05/09/23
Partially implemented the animation, thinking of making a way to make the collisions between player 
and the wall next, stopping movement. Maybe need to think about seperating the walls and the ground
but not sure if the walls as an image rect would be able to decipher what is a part of the image
and transparent background. An idea:
- a function to detect where the player has collided with wall, returns True and variable with pre-position of player when collided
- use condition (if collide is true) 
- and reset player's position to the one detected

name ideas:
wall_collision(player_rect) --> returns true

06/10/23
didn't change animation, still needs a bit of work. Ignored collisions, waiting to do that for later date.
partially implemented the spam minigame, needs a timer, time module? pygame clock?
Thinking about implementing phase 1,2 to differentiate between different game phases when game is active since tempering 
with 'game_active' might not be a good idea.

25/10/23
made the menu change the character sprite.

26/10/23
made instruments object oriented, will work on the time conition for the whole game next time. i did good!
implemented states! idea from 06/10/23 was valid 👍

27/10/23
made collision finally!!!!!!!!! 😁😁😁😀😀
Working on other stages to get an idea of what each stage is gonna look like and stuffs.
(drawing bgs and collidable things)
attempts to fix animation need hellp

01/11/23
migrated important functions 'play_player_animation' and 'collision' and such to 
core_tools.tools. Then fixed every issue that came with it.

deleted 'player_anim_clock' as i found that it delayed play_player_animation (which i did not want)

02/11/23
implementations:
- classroom_image_loader now holds the classes: instrument, Enemy
- made a start on noise_meter, only got numerical values, still needs work
- 2/4 enemy sprites completed
- made new folder for each enemy sprite for organisation 👌

so if i want to add an enemy, i'd have to get the sprites and create an instance of Enemy class
noise meter scales difficulty, which is the factor that increases enemy speed

issues found:
- player animating too fast now <- no idea what to do for this one
- player sprite doesn't change when clicks female in menu <- go through code and re-evaluate things 

04/11/2023
implementations:
- 4/4 enemy sprites comleted and enemy movement completed
- noise meter partialy completed, need sprites
- added timer and condition to game
- added a cat (stakeholder said to)

issues:
- player sprite still doesn't change in menu
- player still animating too fast
^minor issues tbh 

Im pretty sure stage_1 is like 80~90% complete, 
Im tired good night.

05/11/2023
implementations:
- added restarting when player dies to someone

issues:
- player still animating too fast
^minor issue tbh 

10/11/23:
implementation:
- added text above bar minigame
- migrated minigames into core_tools.minigames for re-use
- migrated sprites for minigame

issues:
- player still animating too fast
^minor issue tbh 

11/11/23:
basically complete (minor issues still apply)
ready for status change 😁👌👌

12/11/23:
defeated animation issue once and for all ❤️
